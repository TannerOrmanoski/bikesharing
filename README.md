## Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis is to show how the bike sharing business, Citibike, works in New York City. This understanding will help with the proposition of setting up a similar business in Des Moines.  
  
## Results 
  
Using the Tableau platform, I created multiple visualizations using a csv file of Citibike data.

The first visualization is a line graph depicting trip duration. This visualization shows that most trips last between 0 to 20 minutes.

The next visualization displays trip duration in a line graph, but this graph is broken down by gender. From this, we can see that males use Citibike the most, and their trips primarily last between 0 to 20 min, but some male users had trips that lasted up to 40 min. This graph also shows that all genders seem to have similar trip durations.

The third visualization allows us to see the most popular trip stop times. In this case, Thursday at 5 and 6 pm are the most popular stop times.

The following visualization breaks the third visualization down by gender. This shows that the genders seem to all follow a similar stop time pattern.

The question of who Citibikes number one user is, is answered with this visualization. The answer is shown to be male subscribers.

The last two visualizations show us the most popular starting and stopping locations. From this, we can see that the starting and starting locations are very similar, meaning that the users are not traveling great distances with the bikes. 

## Conclusion

These visualizations point out a few key points. The first point is that most users' trips only last around 10 minutes. The second point is that the most popular stop time is Thursday at 5 and 6 pm. A third point is that the predominant users are male subscribers. The last point is that start and stop location are similar, meaning that most trips are only short distances. To give us a better idea of our New York data, I think two more visualizations could help. A visualization that could help is one that shows the starting point of each user type. This could help us understand the behavior of the subscribing user and the non-subscribing user. Another visualization would be to plot the bikes usage and their starting points. This will allow us to see where the most used bikes are located at and might allow us to conclude if location leads to some bikes being used more than others.
