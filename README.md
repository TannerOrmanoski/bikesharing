## Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis is to show how the bike sharing business, Citibike, works in New York City. This understanding will help with the proposition of setting up a similar business in Des Moines.  
  
## Results 
  
Using the Tableau platform, I created multiple visualizations using a csv file of Citibike data.

The first visualization was a line graph depicting trip duration. This visualization shows that most trips lasted between 0 to 20 minutes.

The next visualization displayed trip duration in a line graph, but this graph is broken down by gender. From this, we can see that males use Citibike the most, and there trips primarily last between 0 to 20 min, but some male users had trips that lasted up to 40 min. This graph also shows that all genders seem to have similar trip durations.

The third visualization allows us to see the most popular trip stop times. In this case Thursday at 5 and 6 pm are the most popular stop times.

The following visualization breaks the third visualization down by gender. This shows that the genders seem to all follow a similar stop time pattern.

The question of who Citibikes number one user is, is answered with this visualization. The answer is shown to be male subscribers.

The last two visualizations show us the most popular starting and stopping locations. From this, we can see that the starting and starting locations are very similar, meaning that the users are not traveling great distances with the bikes.
